# Centos Apache ModSecurity WAF
This is the new CentOS Apache ModSecurity with the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set based Puzzle WAF.  
The main purpose of this WAF is to be loaded into OpenShift projects.

## Environment Variables
Available Environment Variables during startup:

Commonly used environment variables are:  

| Name     | Description|
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PARANOIA` | An integer indicating the paranoia level between 1 and 4 (Default: 1)               |
| `EXECUTING_PARANOIA` | An integer indicating the executing_paranoia_level (Must be equal or higher than PARANOIA) |
| `ANOMALY_INBOUND` | An integer indicating the inbound_anomaly_score_threshold (Default: 5) |
| `ANOMALY_OUTBOUND` | An integer indicating the outbound_anomaly_score_threshold (Default: 4) |
| `PORT` | An integer indicating the listening port of the Apache RP (Default: 8443)               |
| `SERVER_NAME` | A string indicating the Apache ServerName (Default: localhost) |
| `BACKEND` | The IP Address or Name or OpenShift Servicename (and optional port) of the to be protected backend server. (Default: http://localhost:8080) |

For a full list of available environment variables see Dockerfile.  
For an explanation of environment variables see [Links](#links).

## Image quay.io
https://quay.io/repository/puzzleitc/centos-apache-modsecurity

`docker pull quay.io/puzzleitc/centos-apache-modsecurity:crs-v3.2.0-dev`    

The image build is triggered by a GitHub push.

## WAF in OpenShift
To add the WAF to an OpenShift project see [OpenShift README](openshift/README.md).

## TLS Server Certificate und Key
The WAF only listens on HTTPS. No plain HTTP is available.  
A self signed TLS certificate and a key is added to the default image. They must be overwritten by a valid certificate and key!

Example (local docker run):  
`docker run -v $(pwd)/ssl-cert.pem:/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert.pem -v $(pwd)/ssl-cert.key:/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert.key ...`

## Logging
The Apache `access.log` and `error.log` are writte to Standard Out.  
The ModSecurity Audit Logging is set to serial and JSON. This log is written to Standard Out too.  
All these settings can be configured during startup.

## ModSecurity Tuning
In iterative tuning process is recommended.
* Start the pod with a high value for of 200 for ANOMALY_INBOUND and ANOMALY_OUTBOUND
* Test the application and follow an iterative tuning process as described in: https://www.netnea.com/cms/apache-tutorial-8-modsecurity-core-rules-tunen/
* Set an ANOMALY_INBOUND of 5 and ANOMALY_OUTBOUND of 4 to set the WAF to blocking.

Only if these thresholds are lowered in the last step, the WAF is set to blocking.

### Service spezifisches Tuning

Service specific rules can be loaded into the container:  
Rules before CRS: `/etc/httpd/modsecurity/service/custom-before-crs`  
Rules after CRS: `/etc/httpd/modsecurity/service/custom-after-crs`  

### Rule ID Range

We follow Christian Folini (netnea) best practices: 

```
# == ModSec Rule ID Namespace Definition
# Service-specific before Core-Rules:    10000 -  49999
#  - Puzzle Standard Exclusions          10000 -  19999
#  - Service Specific Exclusions         20000 -  49999
# Service-specific after Core-Rules:     50000 -  79999
# Locally shared rules:                  80000 -  99999
#  - Performance:                        90000 -  90199
# Recommended ModSec Rules (few):       200000 - 200010
# OWASP Core-Rules:                     900000 - 999999
```

Important for us (Puzzle) are:
* Puzzle Standard Exclusions before CRS (ids: 10000 - 19999)
* Service Specific Exclusions before CRS (ids: 20000 - 49999)

## To test the container locally:
`docker run -dti -e PARANOIA=2 -e EXECUTING_PARANOIA=2 -e BACKEND='https://myserver:8443 -e SERVERNAME='myserver.puzzle.ch' quay.io/puzzle/centos-apache-modsecurity:latest`

For convenience, a [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yaml) with preconfigured volumes and environment variables is available.
